    abstract = "{Repeated sequences are commonly present in the sites for DNA replication initiation in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic replicons. Those motifs are usually the binding places for replication initiation proteins or replication regulatory factors. In prokaryotic replication origins, the most abundant repeated sequences are DnaA boxes which are the binding sites for chromosomal replication initiation protein DnaA, iterons which bind plasmid or phage DNA replication initiators, defined motifs for site-specific DNA methylation, and 13-nucleotide-long motifs of a not too well-characterized function, which are present within a specific region of replication origin containing higher than average content of adenine and thymine residues. In this review, we specify methods allowing identification of a replication origin, basing on the localization of an AT-rich region and the arrangement of the origin's structural elements. We describe the regularity of the position and structure of the AT-rich regions in bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. The importance of 13-nucleotide-long repeats present at the AT-rich region, as well as other motifs overlapping them, was pointed out to be essential for DNA replication initiation including origin opening, helicase loading and replication complex assembly. We also summarize the role of AT-rich region repeated sequences for DNA replication regulation.}",

    abstract = "{The availability of numerous ChIP-seq datasets for transcription factors (TF) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify all TF binding sites in genomes. However, the progress has been hindered by the lack of a highly efficient and accurate tool to find not only the target motifs, but also cooperative motifs in very big datasets.We herein present an ultrafast and accurate motif-finding algorithm, ProSampler, based on a novel numeration method and Gibbs sampler. ProSampler runs orders of magnitude faster than the fastest existing tools while often more accurately identifying motifs of both the target TFs and cooperators. Thus, ProSampler can greatly facilitate the efforts to identify the entire cis-regulatory code in genomes.Source code and binaries are freely available for download at https://github.com/zhengchangsulab/prosampler. It was implemented in C++ and supported on Linux, macOS and MS Windows platforms.Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = "Summary
DNA shape adds specificity to sequence motifs but has not been explored systematically outside this context. We hypothesized that DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) preferentially occupy DNA with specific structures (“shape motifs”) regardless of whether or not these correspond to high information content sequence motifs. We present ShapeMF, a Gibbs sampling algorithm that identifies de novo shape motifs. Using binding data from hundreds of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that most DBPs have shape motifs and can occupy these in the absence of sequence motifs. This “shape-only binding” is common for many DBPs and in regions co-bound by multiple DBPs. When shape and sequence motifs co-occur, they can be overlapping, flanking, or separated by consistent spacing. Finally, DBPs within the same protein family have different shape motifs, explaining their distinct genome-wide occupancy despite having similar sequence motifs. These results suggest that shape motifs not only complement sequence motifs but also facilitate recognition of DNA beyond conventionally defined sequence motifs."
