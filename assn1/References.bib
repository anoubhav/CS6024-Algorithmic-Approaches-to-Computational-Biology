    abstract = "{Motivation: Genome assembly tools based on the de Bruijn graph framework rely on a parameter k, which represents a trade-off between several competing effects that are difficult to quantify. There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision.Results: We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.Availability: Our tool KmerGenie is freely available at: http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu/.Contact:pashadag@cse.psu.edu}",

    abstract = "{Phosphorylation is the most studied post-translational modification, which is crucial for multiple biological processes. Recently, many efforts have been taken to develop computational predictors for phosphorylation site prediction, but most of them are based on feature selection and discriminative classification. Thus, it is useful to develop a novel and highly accurate predictor that can unveil intricate patterns automatically for protein phosphorylation sites.In this study we present DeepPhos, a novel deep learning architecture for prediction of protein phosphorylation. Unlike multi-layer convolutional neural networks, DeepPhos consists of densely connected convolutional neuron network blocks which can capture multiple representations of sequences to make final phosphorylation prediction by intra block concatenation layers and inter block concatenation layers. DeepPhos can also be used for kinase-specific prediction varying from group, family, subfamily and individual kinase level. The experimental results demonstrated that DeepPhos outperforms competitive predictors in general and kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction.The source code of DeepPhos is publicly deposited at https://github.com/USTCHIlab/DeepPhos.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

The sheer amount of long read data that is being generated enables the assembly for even the largest and most complex organism for which efficient algorithms are needed. We present a new tool, called Ra, for de novo genome assembly of long uncorrected reads.
